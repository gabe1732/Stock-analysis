# Stock-analysis VBA Challenge

## Overview of Stock-Analysis
          The purpose of this project was to write a code that would make it easy to anlyze a group of stock over two years. 
          The code was to summarize the stock information by stock and other pertinat financial information. The code needed 
          to easily identify important inforamation visually as well with color.  This would allow the individual 
          to visually identify successfull stock vs poorly performing stock.  
   
## Results of refactoring and upgrading my code
          Before refactoring my code to include an index of the tickers `Dim tickerIndex As Integer, tickerIndex = 0` the run
          time for 2017 and 2018 were: 
          
 #### 2017 Runtime pre-refactoring

 #### 2018 Runtime pre-refactoring

     Once I refactored the code to include the indexing of the tickers the run time of the code was much faster as you 
     can see below.:
